# Development Progress for USDWZ

This document summarizes the current state of the USDWZ blockchain project and outlines the upcoming roadmap.

## Current State

### Repository Setup
- Source code is organized under `chain` with modules placed in `x/` directories as described in `AGENTS.md`.
- `go.mod` targets Go 1.23 with `toolchain go1.24.3` and integrates Cosmos SDK `v0.47.3`.
- Continuous integration runs `gofmt`, `go vet` and `go test ./...`.

### Implemented Modules
- **Stablecoin** – handles minting, burning and collateral tracking with Prometheus metrics.
- **Escrow** – stores milestone escrow records with create/finalize/list functions.
- **Validator** – records validator votes and tallies results.
- **Yield** – accrues and distributes yield to holders.
- **Audit** – publishes and queries on-chain attestations.
- **Monitoring** – exposes metrics via a Prometheus server.
- **VM** – interpreter for validator-approval scripts used by the escrow logic.
- **App** – assembles all modules into a Cosmos SDK application.
- **CLI** – basic daemon `usdwzd` with a root command.

### Testing
- Unit tests cover each keeper and module implementation under `chain/x/*`.
- Integration tests in `tests/integration` spin up a minimal chain and exercise stablecoin flows, validator scripts and distributed voting scenarios.
- Monitoring metrics and VM logic are also verified through tests.

Overall the code compiles and all tests pass, demonstrating a functional prototype of the USDWZ chain.

## Six‑Month Roadmap
1. **Finalize Module APIs (Month 1‑2)**
   - Implement full message types, client commands and gRPC queries for each module.
   - Flesh out the CLI for end‑users and validators.
2. **M^0 and IBC Integration (Month 2‑3)**
   - Connect collateral management to live M^0 infrastructure.
   - Enable ICS20 transfers for USDWZ across the Cosmos ecosystem.
3. **Public Testnet (Month 3‑4)**
   - Launch a multi-validator testnet showcasing milestone escrow and voting.
   - Gather community feedback and iterate on validator scripts.
4. **Security & Compliance (Month 4‑5)**
   - Perform external audits of the codebase and reserves.
   - Finalize KYC/AML processes as described in `docs/kyc_aml.md`.
5. **Mainnet Preparation (Month 5‑6)**
   - Harden monitoring and alerting using the `monitoring` package.
   - Complete on-chain governance parameters and create the genesis configuration.
   - Schedule mainnet launch following successful testnet results.

USDWZ is progressing steadily toward a fully operational chain backed by M^0 reserves and secured by validator arbitration.
